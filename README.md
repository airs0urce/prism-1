# Prism.js MongoDB Partial Syntaxes

Here is list of new syntaxes:

- mongodb-aggregation (MongoDB Aggregation)
- mongodb-document (MongoDB Document)
- mongodb-update (MongoDB Update)
- mongodb-filter (MongoDB Filter)

Note: if you don't need partial highlighting for mongodb, you can use "mongodb" syntax which is already merged to main Prism.js repo and available on https://prismjs.com/.

[How to edit syntaxes before using](#how-to-edit-syntaxes-before-using)

Each syntax highlights only JS object sent as part of query. For example:

mongodb-filter will highlight this:
```
{
    age: {$gt: 18},
    children: {$exists: true}
}
```

mongodb-update will highlight this:
```
{
    $set: {age: 20},
    $inc: {children: 2}
}
```

etc.

Recently I contributed "mongodb" syntax to Prism.js. It extends javascript syntax and highlights all MongoDB keywords like $get, $set, $where, $gt, etc, so all types of keywords (query, aggregation, update) and also functions like ObjectId(), Timestamp(), etc. Here you can read discussion in these two pull requests:  
https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2502  
https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2518

So, all feature were implemented in one syntax. But for my project (https://github.com/airs0urce/punkmongo) I need support of partial mongodb syntaxes, because when I highlight "update" part of query I don't want Prism.js to highlight $lt, $gt or any other operations used only in "filter" part of query.
As creating of sub-languages is not the approach Prism.js follow, I had to create this fork and add new syntaxes to be able to highlight only certain part of query. 



## How to use the new syntaxes

Clone repo https://github.com/airs0urce/prism-mongodb
```
$ git clone https://github.com/airs0urce/prism-mongodb  
$ cd prism-mongodb
$ npm install  
```

Run http server inside prism-mongodb folder
```
$ cd prism-mongodb
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server -c-1
```

See what port http server started on and go to download.html, for example:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/download.html

Select "Minified version" and in Languages check syntaxes you need, go to page bottom and click "Download JS" and "Download CSS".
Then use downloaded files same like you use other prism.js syntaxes, see instruction here: https://prismjs.com/#basic-usage

language classes:
- language-mongodb-aggregation
- language-mongodb-document
- language-mongodb-update
- language-mongodb-filter

## How to edit syntaxes before using

Clone repo https://github.com/airs0urce/prism-mongodb.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/airs0urce/prism-mongodb  
$ cd prism-mongodb
$ npm install  
```

Run http server inside prism-mongodb folder
```
$ cd prism-mongodb
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server -c-1
```

See what address http server started on and go to test.html, for example:
Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.html

On this page select any of mongo syntaxes:

- MongoDB Aggregation
- MongoDB Document
- MongoDB Update
- MongoDB Filter

And then on this page you can check how highlight works.
To change syntaxes edit these files:

```
components/prism-mongodb-aggregation.js
components/prism-mongodb-document.js
components/prism-mongodb-update.js
components/prism-mongodb-filter.js
```

After edit you have to refresh page.

When you finish editing syntaxes:

1) Delete old minified version:
```
$ rm -f components/prism-mongodb-aggregation.min.js
$ rm -f components/prism-mongodb-document.min.js
$ rm -f components/prism-mongodb-update.min.js
$ rm -f components/prism-mongodb-filter.min.js
```

2) Build:
```
$ npm run build
```

3) Go to [How to use the new syntaxes](#how-to-use-the-new-syntaxes) and follow instructions there.
